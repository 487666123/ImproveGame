	BasicIntroduction:
		'''
		Note:
		  1. Chest sorting depends on identifiers prefixed
		     on the chests' names. Please do NOT arbitrarily
		     edit chest names
		  2. You still need to sort items manually
		     The identifiers are just for convenience
		  3. In multiplayer mode, if a chest is being used by
		     another player, you are not able to take actions
		     on items inside the chest
